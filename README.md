# JUnit My Framework

Welcome to the JUnit My Framework repository! This repo is for educational purposes, demonstrating how to use a simple framework to write repeatable tests. 

## Introduction

This project is based on study of the JUnit framework and reflections on its construction. It is inspired by the concepts presented in "JUnit A Cook's Tour."

For more information, please visit the [Cook's Tour documentation](https://curlunit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm).
